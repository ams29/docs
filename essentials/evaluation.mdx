## Measuring Success: The Role of Evaluations

Given the substantial investment in model training, tracking improvement becomes crucial. Evaluation datasets ("evals") provide standardized metrics for specific capabilities, enabling teams to make data-driven decisions about model development and deployment.

<Note>
Evaluations are not just metricsâ€”they're your compass for model improvement. Without proper evals, you're flying blind.
</Note>

## Structure of Evaluation Datasets

Each evaluation dataset contains three core components:

  Questions or tasks that test specific model capabilities

  Correct answers or validation criteria for scoring

## Key Evaluation Challenges

### Benchmark Limitations

Standard benchmarks come with inherent challenges:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Common Benchmarks">
**MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**
- 57 subjects across STEM, humanities, social sciences
- Multiple-choice format
- Risk: May not reflect real-world application needs

**GSM8K (Grade School Math)**
- 8,500 grade school math problems
- Tests mathematical reasoning
- Risk: Limited to basic arithmetic scenarios

**HumanEval**
- 164 Python programming problems
- Tests code generation abilities
- Risk: Doesn't cover all programming paradigms

**Chatbot Arena**
- Human preference comparisons
- Real-world conversation quality
- Risk: Subjective and resource-intensive
</Tab>

<Tab title="Contamination Risks">
<Warning>
Training data contamination occurs when evaluation examples leak into training datasets, inflating performance metrics without genuine capability improvement.
</Warning>

Prevention strategies:
- Use recent, proprietary evaluations
- Rotate evaluation sets regularly
- Create hold-out sets from new data
- Monitor for suspiciously high scores
</Tab>

<Tab title="Coverage Gaps">
Standard benchmarks often miss:
- Domain-specific requirements
- Cultural and linguistic nuances
- Real-world task complexity
- Edge cases and failure modes
- Multi-step reasoning chains
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating Custom Evaluations

<Steps>
<Step title="Define Evaluation Objectives">
Clearly articulate what capabilities you're measuring:
- Specific skills (e.g., SQL generation, medical diagnosis)
- Quality attributes (accuracy, safety, style)
- User satisfaction metrics
- Business-specific KPIs
</Step>

<Step title="Design Test Cases">
Create comprehensive test suites:
- **Easy cases**: Baseline functionality
- **Medium cases**: Typical use scenarios
- **Hard cases**: Edge cases and complex reasoning
- **Adversarial cases**: Potential failure modes
</Step>

<Step title="Establish Scoring Criteria">
Develop clear, reproducible scoring methods:
- Automated metrics where possible
- Human evaluation rubrics when needed
- Combination approaches for nuanced tasks
</Step>

<Step title="Validate and Iterate">
Ensure evaluation quality:
- Test on known good/bad models
- Verify inter-rater agreement
- Adjust based on initial results
- Document all assumptions
</Step>
</Steps>
