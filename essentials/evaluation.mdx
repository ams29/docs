## Measuring Success: The Role of Evaluations

Given the substantial investment in model training, tracking improvement becomes crucial. Evaluation datasets ("evals") provide standardized metrics for specific capabilities, enabling teams to make data-driven decisions about model development and deployment.

<Note>
Evaluations are not just metricsâ€”they're your compass for model improvement. Without proper evals, you're flying blind.
</Note>

## Structure of Evaluation Datasets

Each evaluation dataset contains three core components:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Test Prompts" icon="message">
  Questions or tasks that test specific model capabilities
</Card>

<Card title="Ground Truth" icon="check-circle">
  Correct answers or validation criteria for scoring
</Card>

<Card title="Scoring Logic" icon="calculator">
  Mechanisms to evaluate model outputs against expectations
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example Evaluation Formats

<CodeGroup>
```json Multiple Choice
{
  "question": "What is the capital of France?",
  "choices": ["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Madrid"],
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "category": "geography",
  "difficulty": "easy"
}
```

```json Open-Ended Generation
{
  "prompt": "Write a Python function to calculate factorial",
  "test_cases": [
    {"input": 5, "expected": 120},
    {"input": 0, "expected": 1},
    {"input": 10, "expected": 3628800}
  ],
  "evaluation_type": "code_execution"
}
```

```json Comparative Evaluation
{
  "context": "Article about climate change...",
  "task": "Summarize in 3 sentences",
  "criteria": {
    "accuracy": "Must mention key points",
    "conciseness": "Under 75 words",
    "coherence": "Logical flow between sentences"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Key Evaluation Challenges

### Benchmark Limitations

Standard benchmarks come with inherent challenges:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Common Benchmarks">
**MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**
- 57 subjects across STEM, humanities, social sciences
- Multiple-choice format
- Risk: May not reflect real-world application needs

**GSM8K (Grade School Math)**
- 8,500 grade school math problems
- Tests mathematical reasoning
- Risk: Limited to basic arithmetic scenarios

**HumanEval**
- 164 Python programming problems
- Tests code generation abilities
- Risk: Doesn't cover all programming paradigms

**Chatbot Arena**
- Human preference comparisons
- Real-world conversation quality
- Risk: Subjective and resource-intensive
</Tab>

<Tab title="Contamination Risks">
<Warning>
Training data contamination occurs when evaluation examples leak into training datasets, inflating performance metrics without genuine capability improvement.
</Warning>

Prevention strategies:
- Use recent, proprietary evaluations
- Rotate evaluation sets regularly
- Create hold-out sets from new data
- Monitor for suspiciously high scores
</Tab>

<Tab title="Coverage Gaps">
Standard benchmarks often miss:
- Domain-specific requirements
- Cultural and linguistic nuances
- Real-world task complexity
- Edge cases and failure modes
- Multi-step reasoning chains
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating Custom Evaluations

<Steps>
<Step title="Define Evaluation Objectives">
Clearly articulate what capabilities you're measuring:
- Specific skills (e.g., SQL generation, medical diagnosis)
- Quality attributes (accuracy, safety, style)
- User satisfaction metrics
- Business-specific KPIs
</Step>

<Step title="Design Test Cases">
Create comprehensive test suites:
- **Easy cases**: Baseline functionality
- **Medium cases**: Typical use scenarios
- **Hard cases**: Edge cases and complex reasoning
- **Adversarial cases**: Potential failure modes
</Step>

<Step title="Establish Scoring Criteria">
Develop clear, reproducible scoring methods:
- Automated metrics where possible
- Human evaluation rubrics when needed
- Combination approaches for nuanced tasks
</Step>

<Step title="Validate and Iterate">
Ensure evaluation quality:
- Test on known good/bad models
- Verify inter-rater agreement
- Adjust based on initial results
- Document all assumptions
</Step>
</Steps>

## Types of Evaluation Approaches

### Automated Evaluations

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Exact Match">
```python
def exact_match_eval(prediction, ground_truth):
    return prediction.strip().lower() == ground_truth.strip().lower()
```

Best for:

- Standardized outputs
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Semantic Similarity">
```python
def semantic_similarity_eval(prediction, reference, threshold=0.85):
    embedding_pred = get_embedding(prediction)
    embedding_ref = get_embedding(reference)
    similarity = cosine_similarity(embedding_pred, embedding_ref)
    return similarity > threshold
```

Best for:

- Content matching
- Flexible responses
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Code Execution">
```python
def code_execution_eval(generated_code, test_cases):

        exec(generated_code, globals())
        passed = sum(1 for test in test_cases 
                    if function(test['input']) == test['expected'])
        return passed / len(test_cases)
    except:
        return 0.0
```

Best for:

## Best Practices for Evaluation Design

<Tip>
Develop evaluation sets before fine-tuning begins to enable consistent performance tracking throughout the development process.
</Tip>

### Coverage Requirements

Comprehensive evaluations must span:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Capability Coverage">
- Core functionalities
- Edge cases
- Failure modes
- Performance boundaries
- Cross-domain transfer
</Tab>

<Tab title="Difficulty Distribution">
```python
evaluation_distribution = {
    "easy": 0.2,      # Sanity checks
    "medium": 0.5,    # Typical use cases
    "hard": 0.2,      # Challenging scenarios
    "expert": 0.1     # Pushing boundaries
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Data Diversity">
- Multiple domains

- Cultural contexts
- Temporal relevance
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Evaluation-Driven Development

### Pre-Training Evaluations

Monitor fundamental capabilities:
- Language understanding
- Factual knowledge
- Reasoning ability
- Generation quality

### Fine-Tuning Evaluations

Track task-specific improvements:
- Before/after comparisons
- Regression detection
- Capability transfer
- Overfitting indicators

### Production Evaluations

Continuous monitoring in deployment:
- A/B testing frameworks
- User satisfaction metrics
- Error rate tracking
- Performance degradation alerts

## Alternative Evaluation Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Comparative Ranking">
Instead of absolute scoring, rank model versions:

```python
def comparative_evaluation(model_a, model_b, test_set):
    wins_a = 0
    wins_b = 0
    
    for prompt in test_set:
        response_a = model_a.generate(prompt)
        response_b = model_b.generate(prompt)
        
        winner = human_preference(response_a, response_b)
        if winner == 'a':
            wins_a += 1
        else:
            wins_b += 1
    
    return wins_a / (wins_a + wins_b)
```

Benefits:
- Easier for annotators
- More stable results
- Direct comparison
- Relative improvement tracking
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multi-Stage Evaluation">
Progressive evaluation pipeline:

1. **Automated filtering**: Quick checks for obvious issues
2. **Targeted automated evals**: Domain-specific metrics
3. **Human spot-checks**: Quality verification
4. **User studies**: Real-world validation

This approach balances thoroughness with resource efficiency.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Synthetic Evaluation Generation">
Use models to create evaluation sets:

```python
def generate_eval_questions(topic, difficulty, num_questions):
    prompt = f"""Generate {num_questions} evaluation questions about {topic} 
                at {difficulty} difficulty level. Include answers."""
    
    questions = model.generate(prompt)
    human_verified = verify_quality(questions)
    return human_verified
```

Considerations:
- Requires human verification
- Can increase coverage
- Risk of distribution shift
- Useful for rapid iteration
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

<Warning>
Though creating quality evaluations requires investment, it proves far more economical than deploying inadequately tested models.
</Warning>

### Investment Comparison

| Evaluation Type | Setup Cost | Ongoing Cost | Value |
|----------------|------------|--------------|--------|
