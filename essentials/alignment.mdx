## Aligning Models with Human Values via RLHF

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) represents an advanced fine-tuning approach that shapes model behavior according to human preferences. This process typically follows initial supervised training and aims to align model outputs with human values, safety requirements, and desired behaviors.

<Note>
RLHF has been instrumental in creating helpful, harmless, and honest AI assistants by incorporating human judgment directly into the training process.
</Note>

## The RLHF Workflow

The RLHF process comprises several key stages:

<Steps>
<Step title="Preference Collection">
Models generate multiple responses per prompt, which humans then rank or rate based on quality criteria.

<Info>
Preferences often use 1-7 Likert scales, potentially broken down by attributes like accuracy, usefulness, and tone.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Reward Model Training">
A separate model learns to predict human preferences based on the collected ranking data.
</Step>

<Step title="Policy Optimization">
The main model is updated using reinforcement learning algorithms to maximize the predicted reward.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Preference Data Collection

### Response Generation and Ranking

For each prompt, the model generates multiple candidate responses that annotators evaluate:

<CodeGroup>
```json Simple Ranking
{
  "prompt": "Explain quantum computing to a beginner",
  "responses": [
    {
      "text": "Quantum computing uses quantum bits...",
      "rank": 1
    },
    {
      "text": "Think of it like a super powerful computer...",
      "rank": 2
    },
    {
      "text": "Quantum computers are machines that...",
      "rank": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

```json Detailed Scoring
{
  "prompt": "Write a professional email declining a meeting",
  "response": "Thank you for the invitation...",
  "scores": {
    "helpfulness": 6,
    "professionalism": 7,
    "clarity": 6,
    "conciseness": 5
  }
}
```

```json Pairwise Comparison
{
  "prompt": "Summarize this article",
  "response_a": "The article discusses...",
  "response_b": "This piece explores...",
  "preference": "response_a",
  "margin": "strong"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Evaluation Criteria

Human annotators typically assess responses across multiple dimensions:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Accuracy">
- Factual correctness
- Logical consistency
- Completeness of information
- Absence of hallucinations
</Tab>

<Tab title="Helpfulness">
- Addresses user intent
- Provides actionable information
- Appropriate level of detail
- Clear next steps when applicable
</Tab>

<Tab title="Safety">
- Avoids harmful content
- Respects user privacy
- Maintains appropriate boundaries
- Follows ethical guidelines
</Tab>

<Tab title="Style">
- Appropriate tone
- Clear communication
- Professional language
- Cultural sensitivity
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Model Optimization Approaches

### Traditional RLHF Pipeline

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Reward Model Training">
The reward model learns to predict human preferences:

```python
# Conceptual reward model training
def train_reward_model(preference_data):
    for prompt, response_a, response_b, preference in preference_data:
        score_a = reward_model(prompt, response_a)
        score_b = reward_model(prompt, response_b)
        loss = compute_ranking_loss(score_a, score_b, preference)
        optimize(loss)
```

Key considerations:
- Requires substantial preference data (typically 50K+ comparisons)
- Model architecture often mirrors the base model
- Calibration is crucial for accurate reward prediction
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)">
PPO updates the main model using the reward signal:

```python
# Simplified PPO update
def ppo_update(model, reward_model, prompts):
    for prompt in prompts:
        response = model.generate(prompt)
        reward = reward_model(prompt, response)
        advantage = compute_advantage(reward)
        update_policy(model, advantage, kl_constraint)
```

Challenges:
- Computationally intensive
- Requires careful hyperparameter tuning
- Risk of reward hacking
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Direct Policy Optimization (DPO)

DPO streamlines the process by incorporating preferences directly without a separate reward model:

<Card title="DPO Advantages" icon="rocket">
- Eliminates reward model training
- More stable optimization
- Reduced computational requirements
- Direct preference learning
</Card>

<CodeGroup>
```json DPO Training Data
{
  "prompt": "Explain the benefits of exercise",
  "chosen": "Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health...",
  "rejected": "Exercise is good for you because...",
  "metadata": {
    "chosen_score": 0.85,
    "rejected_score": 0.42
  }
}
```

```python DPO Loss Function
# Simplified DPO objective
def dpo_loss(model, prompt, chosen, rejected, beta=0.1):
    chosen_logprob = model.log_prob(prompt, chosen)
    rejected_logprob = model.log_prob(prompt, rejected)
    
    reward_chosen = beta * chosen_logprob
    reward_rejected = beta * rejected_logprob
    
    return -log_sigmoid(reward_chosen - reward_rejected)
```
</CodeGroup>
