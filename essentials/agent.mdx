## Supporting Autonomous Agent Development

Agent-based systems require specialized data to enable autonomous task execution. Unlike traditional conversational AI, agents must plan, execute, and adapt to achieve complex goals across extended workflows.

<Note>
Agent training data focuses on decision-making, tool usage, and multi-step reasoning rather than just conversation.
