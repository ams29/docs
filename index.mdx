# Human Data @ MangoDesk

## We are uncompromising on Quality.

- All of our contributors are domain experts who are [rigorously interviewed and task‑tested](https://www.mangodesk.com/) before they contribute to your dataset. The level of rigor in our screening process matches that of full interview loops at elite companies.
- We take a high-touch approach to managing our pipelines. We obsess over detail, from the contributor selection to the task interface, pipeline design, and automated quality checks, to maintain our high bar for quality.
- Our contributor screening and labeling infrastructure layers proprietary technology on top of industry best practices to deliver on contributor and data quality at scale.
